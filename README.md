# Reflections

This design thinking project has helped me understand the process of creating and developing a new system to solve problems around us. It also helped me understand the concept of System Development
Life Cycle much further as I was actively participating in the process whereas before I only learned it as a theory and didn't really apply the concept to solve problems.
<br><br>As for any improvements that I could make for future projects, I think time management is the most important aspect that I should definitely improve on. With better time management
skills, this project would have definitely be finished ahead of schedule. Other than that, I also think that I should learn many more professional skills and tools such as video editing,
photoshop and many more so that my work can be more professional and higher quality.
